This query is to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers by total amount paid.
The following tables were used: Customer, Address, city, country, and payment. 
A CTE was created to easily answer business questions that raised about the top 5 customers by amount paid,



With top_5_customers_cte (top_customer, 
                          top_city,
                          top_total_amount_paid) 
AS (
  SELECT table_customer.customer_id,  
         city.city, 
         SUM(table_payment.amount) AS total_amount_paid
  FROM Customer AS table_customer
  INNER JOIN Address AS table_address ON table_customer.address_id = table_address.address_id
  INNER JOIN city AS table_city ON table_address.city_id = table_city.city_id
  INNER JOIN country AS table_country ON table_city.country_id = table_country.country_id
  INNER JOIN payment AS table_payment ON table_payment.customer_id = table_customer.customer_id
  GROUP BY table_customer.customer_id, table_city.city, table_country.country

  ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
  LIMIT 5)


-- The 2 queries below were performed separately.
-- They both used the CTE from above to utilize information about the top 5 customers.
